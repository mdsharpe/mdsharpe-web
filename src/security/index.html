                    <h2>Don't use the same password across multiple websites or apps</h2>
                    <p>Use a password manager to create and store long, strong passwords that you don't need to remember.</p>

                    <h2>Don't click on links or attachments in emails you weren't expecting</h2>
                    <p>Scammers often use links and attachments to infect your computer with malware or viruses. Be cautious of any links or attachments from unknown sources.</p>
                </li>

                    <h2>Don't give away personal information</h2>
                    <p>Never give away your personal details, such as your bank account or credit card number, to anyone you don't know or trust.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li class="security-tip-container">
                    <h2>Don't trust unexpected phone calls</h2>
                    <p>If you receive a call claiming to be from an organization e.g. a bank, don't start divulging details to them.</p>
                    <p>Instead, take that person's details and tell them you'll call back.</p>
                    <p>Then, once you're off the call, look up the organization's phone number and call them yourself.</p>
